## FS-GNNTR: Few-shot Learning with Transformers via Graph Embeddings for Molecular Property Prediction

In this work, we propose a few-shot GNN-Transformer architecture, FS-GNNTR to face the problem of low-data in molecular property prediction. It is demonstrated that this model provides strong boosts when predicting molecular properties on few-shot data over simple graph-based methods.

The GNN-Transformer network learns deep representations from graph-level embeddings. First, a GNN module encodes the structural information of molecular graphs as a set of node and edge features. Node and edge embeddings are then converted into graph embedding representations by neighborhood aggregation. Then, a vision Transformer encoder exploits the contextual information of these vectorial embeddings to propagate deep representations across attention layers.

A two-module meta-learning framework was explored to optimize model parameters across tasks and quickly adapt to new molecular properties on few-shot data.

Extensive experiments on real multiproperty prediction data, Tox21 and SIDER, demonstrate the predictive power and stable performances of the proposed model when inferring task-specific molecular properties.

This repository provides the source code and datasets for the proposed work.

## Data Availability and Pre-Processing

The Tox21 and SIDER datasets are downloaded from the repository [Data](http://snap.stanford.edu/gnn-pretrain/data/) (chem_dataset.zip) from [Hu et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265). 

Raw data is pre-processed and SMILES strings are converted into molecular graphs using RDKit.Chem. 

The implementation is based on [Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks (Hu et al.) (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265).
